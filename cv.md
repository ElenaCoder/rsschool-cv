## About me
I am a software development student at Omnia college in Finland. I have been living in Helsinki for 3 years, but I am originally from Moscow. I have a degree in Math (Applied Mathematics). I am highly interested in learning new things in the web development area. My teachers describe me as a self-disciplined and goal-focused person who pushes themselves to achieve success. I have recently joined a self-study education program in Rolling Scopes school with a mentor's support. I believe it will be beneficial for my career and it helps me to achieve corresponding competences for the junior level position.

## Code examples
#### Description: 
Task “Split Strings” from Codewars.com site:
Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').
**Examples**:
```
> 'abc' =>  ['ab', 'c_']
- 'abcdef' => ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']
```
#### Code:
```
function solution(str){
  const len = str.length;
  const result = [];
  
  if(len % 2 !== 0){
     str += "_";
     }
   
  for(let i = 0; i < len; i=i+2){
    result.push(str.slice(i,i+2));
  }
  
  return result;
}
```
