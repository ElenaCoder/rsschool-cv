## About me
I am a software development student at Omnia college in Finland. I have been living in Helsinki for 3 years, but I am originally from Moscow. I have a degree in Math (Applied Mathematics). I am highly interested in learning new things in the web development area. My teachers describe me as a self-disciplined and goal-focused person who pushes themselves to achieve success. I have recently joined a self-study education program in Rolling Scopes school with a mentor's support. I believe it will be beneficial for my career and it helps me to achieve corresponding competences for the junior level position.
